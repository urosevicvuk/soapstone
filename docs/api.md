# API

Messages and errors are JSON. An error looks like `{"error": "…"}`.

A message:

```json
{"id": 1, "author": "Solaire", "text": "Praise the Sun", "createdAt": "2026-10-12T10:00:00Z"}
```

`id` starts at 1 and only grows, and `createdAt` is in UTC. Leading and trailing spaces are trimmed before validation: `author` has 1–40 characters, `text` 1–280.

| Method and path | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | HTML page with messages and a form |
| `GET /api/messages?limit=50` | 200, list from newest; `limit` from 1 to 200, otherwise 400 |
| `POST /api/messages` | body `{"author": "…", "text": "…"}`; 201 with the message, or 400 |
| `GET /api/messages/{id}` | 200 or 404 |
| `DELETE /api/messages/{id}` | 204 with no body, or 404 |
| `GET /healthz` | 200, `ok`: the process is running |
| `GET /readyz` | 200, `ready`; or 503 with the reason, when the database is unreachable or its schema is not on the latest version |
| `GET /version` | 200, `{"version": "…", "commit": "…", "goVersion": "…"}`: what this binary was built from; `dev` and `unknown` unless set at build time |

Examples:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/api/messages | jq
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/api/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"author":"Ana","text":"Try jumping"}' | jq
curl -s -X DELETE localhost:8080/api/messages/1
```

## Configuration

All settings are env variables. `make run` also loads `.env`, if it exists.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8080` | server port |
| `APP_COLOR` | `steelblue` | page header color: a CSS color name (`tomato`) or hex (`#ff6347`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `json` | `json` or `text`; logs go to stdout, one line per request |
| `DATABASE_URL` | empty | Postgres URL, `postgres://user:password@host:5432/db?sslmode=disable`; empty means messages live in memory |

Without `DATABASE_URL` messages live in process memory and are gone when the app stops. With it they live in Postgres. The app does not create its tables on start: run `soapstone migrate` (same `DATABASE_URL`) first, and again after every update. It creates or updates the schema and exits; when the schema is already up to date it does nothing. Until then `/readyz` returns 503.

## Version and health check

`soapstone version` prints the version and commit the binary was built from, and `GET /version` returns the same as JSON. Both are written into the binary at build time, with `-ldflags`:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X github.com/urosevicvuk/soapstone/internal/buildinfo.Version=v0.2.0 \
  -X github.com/urosevicvuk/soapstone/internal/buildinfo.Commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" \
  -o bin/soapstone ./cmd/soapstone
```

Without them they are `dev` and `unknown`.

`soapstone healthcheck` calls `/healthz` of the server on `PORT` (default 8080) on the same machine and exits with 0 when it answers 200, otherwise with 1. It is meant for a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` in an image without `curl` or a shell.
